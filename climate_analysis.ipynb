    "SQLAlchemy ORM\n",
    "One of the primary features of SQLAlchemy is the Object Relational Mapper, which is commonly referred to as ORM. ORM allows you to create classes in your code that can be mapped to specific tables in a given database. This allows us to create a special type of system called a decoupled system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand ORMs and decoupled systems, consider the following scenario. Suppose you are cleaning out the garage, and you find a bunch of wires or ropes that are all knotted together. We would call this a tightly coupled system: all of the different ropes are connected to each other, so if we go to grab just one, the whole mess comes along with it. What the ORM does for us is untangle—or decouple—all of those ropes, so we can use just one of them at a time. When we pick one up, we won't pick up the whole knot; or, if one element breaks, it doesn't affect any of the other cords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, the less coupling in our code, the better. If there are a bunch of relationships between all of your coding components and one of them breaks, everything breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORM helps us keep our systems decoupled. We'll get into more specific details about how we can keep our code decoupled, but for now, just remember that your references will be to classes in your code instead of specific tables in the database, and that we'll be able to influence each class independently."

    "You can compare SQLite databases to a CSV or Excel file: \n",

    "The key difference between SQLite databases and a CSV or Excel file is that we can write queries for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *It's local. One of the core advantages of SQLite is that it allows you to create databases locally on your computer to support testing and easy prototyping. This is beneficial, because if you want to test something out and you need a database, it's not always the most convenient to set up a SQL database server just to try something out.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *There's an app for that. Another advantage of SQLite databases are that they can be used on a mobile phone app. Most mobile phone games will use an SQLite database to store certain information about you or your players statistics. While we won't be creating a mobile app in this module, it's still helpful to understand the full context.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The disadvantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *It's local. If you've used a MYSQL database before, you might have noticed that you can have multiple users access the database. With SQLite, there are no users. SQL is local: stored on one computer or phone. So, only that computer or phone will have access.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *There are fewer security features: one other disadvantage to be aware of is that SQLite doesn't have as many security features as a traditional SQL database. While it's not something specifically to be concerned with for this module, just keep that in mind as you create other databases later on."
